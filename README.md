# CENG113 - PROGRAMMING BASICS
# ASSIGNMENT2 - TravelTimeCalculator_ProgrammingBasics_2
Travel time calculator
In this homework, you will implement a program which is able to estimate approximate travel
time according to flight distances.

Similarly to HW01, submissions will be mostly graded automatically therefore outputs must be
the same as for all example runs (don't forget to use the new line character “\n” as you see in the
outputs). User inputs outlined in orange and others in black.

Example run #1:

Departure province:

Izmir

Arrival province:

Ankara

Enter travel type:

Car

I am calculating the distance between IZMIR and ANKARA ...

Distance: 591.91 km

Approximate travel time with CAR: 6 hours 34 minutes

Recommended places close to IZMIR:AYDIN,BALIKESIR,MANISA
